#   IDEA: Drum Pattern Database
### This database will allow a user to search any drum pattern on the website. Once seleted, the drum pattern will be shown with the correct drum set for 8 bars. 

### Users can create their own drum patterns in a live-time session, allowing other users to edit the same drum pattern in the same live time data. 


##  PLAN
### 1. Create a live time chat using go websockets. This will set the foundation for sharing and creating real time drum patterns. 

### 2. Create a smiple interactive graphic to create drum patterns, then implement the live chat feature such that the drum pattern will be real time data. 

### 3. Create a simple database allowing admins to add and delete drum patterns throught a front end. 

### 4. Create a front end that will sepertate but combine the database and live pattern feature.
